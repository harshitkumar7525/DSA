# Dynamic Programming
### What is DP?
It is just a enhanced recursion technique.
In DP, we store the values obtained in the recursive calls. These stored values are directly used in the overlapping sub-problems.

### When to apply DP?
Conditions are:
* Problem ke andar choices dii hongi
* Hrr level prr multiple recursive calls ho rahi hongi (must have condition) jo ki overlapping hongi
* Optimal/Maximum/Minimum puch rhe honge

#### DP methods
* Memomization (Top-Down)
* Tabulation (Bottom-up)

### Steps:
* First try to write recursive solution
* then try to memoize
* then use tabulation

### What to memoize ? 
Look at the parameter which is changing and make a table for that parameter
