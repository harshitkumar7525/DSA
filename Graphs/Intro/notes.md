# Graph
It is collection of nodes and edges.
It is of two types:
<br>
* Undirected Graph: In this we can move in both the directions on the edge
* Directed Graph: In this we can only travel in one direction on the edge.

#### Weighted Edge:
The edges in a graph may have a weight attached to it, if it's not given we assume it to be 1 unit.

<b>Path</b>:
It is collection of nodes or/and edges in a consecutive sequence such that no edge is repeated twice.
<br>

<b>Degree of a Node:</b>
* Undirected Graph: The number of edges attached to a node.
* Directed Graph: <br>
    i. In-degree: The total number of edges going inside a node.<br>
    ii. Out-degree: The total number of edges going outside a node.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> The sum of all degrees is twice the number of edges.
